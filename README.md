## Reminders

- Use this application in your computer, not phone.
- Before entering, make sure to set the window to fullscreen, the layout will break if the window is not large enough.
- Do not manipulate the files that are generated by the program, this is where the application stores your data.
- If you tried running the app and nothing happens, it is likely that your computer is blocking the app because it thinks it is a virus. You may need to turn it off or maybe click "run anyway" if there is an option. Or try runnning it as administrator.
